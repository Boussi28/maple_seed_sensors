# 3D model:
The maple seed inspired designs were modelled in Autodesk Fusion 360, using a spline-
fitting method based on photographs of dried samaras collected around Bristol. The CAD 
models replicate key morphological features such as:

- Nut and wing shape
- Leading edge thickness
- Centre of gravity biased towards the nut

# 3D printing parameters:  
Printer used: Bambulab P1P
Slicer: Bambu Studio
Materials:
- PLA (Bambulab, 1.75mm)
- PVA (eSun, 1.75mm, water soluble)

# Key print settings:
Layer height: 0.05mm
First layer height: 0.05mm
Infill pattern: cubic
Infill density: 20%
Top / bottom pattern: concentric 
Print orientation: flat (wing-down)

# Printing Notes: 
- Thin models make the prints delicate. Take care when removing from the bed. 
- PVA filament is highly moisture sensitive. Ensure it is dry before use to prevent poor extrusion.
