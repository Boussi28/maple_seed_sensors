# üçÅ Biodegradable maple seed inspired sensors for environmental monitoring

This project explores the design, fabrication, and analysis of biodegradable, electronics-free sensors, inspired by the aerodynamic properties of maple seeds. These sensors are intended for distributed, low-cost environmental monitoring (e.g. pH detection) and are capable of passive wind dispersal.


# Features

- Bio-inspired design for efficient wind dispersal
- Electronics-free and biodegradable 
- Visual pH sensing at point of contact
- Image processing for autorotation and dispersal analysis


# Project Overview

Modern environmental monitoring systems often rely on electronics that contribute to e-waste. This project explores a sustainable alternative by using biodegradable materials and passive aerodynamics inspired by samaras (maple seeds).

Each design integrates:
- A 3D-printed biodegradable body (PLA/PVA)
- Colour-based pH sensing using flavin powder
- Passive autorotation and dispersal, with no electronics
- Image analysis and flight tracking using OpenCV and MATLAB
